# flingthing

## Description
The goal of this project is to implement Active Noise Cancellation on a Sparkfun QuickLogic Thing Plus platform. We'll start with getting the board up and running and getting familiar with working on the platform. Eventually we'll work up to running a realtime OS on an optimized soft core processor for streaming and processing audio.

## Installation
git clone this repo.

## Usage
Build and load the FPGA/arm.

## Roadmap
